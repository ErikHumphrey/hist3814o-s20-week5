## Static websites

* This isn't anything I haven't done before, but let's do it again for practice!
* GitHub Pages is something that tends not to work the first time even if you follow the instrutions verbatim, possibly due to how web hosting works, but it's a fun gamble.
* Because I don't want to affect the *username.github.io* I may already have set up on this GitHub account that's been around for awhile, I instead used this Week 5 repository for GitHub Pages. This makes the static website end up in a subdirectory of *username.github.io*. In my case, [erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/](https://erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/).
* I created the "[index.md](docs/index.md)" rather than at the top level, to separate it from the rest of the repository.
  * I also made [an HTML version](static-websites/unused-index.html) as a backup, in case Markdown didn't end up working.
* After selecting the "master branch /docs folder" as the GitHub Pages source in the repository's settings, I selected a Jekyll theme on GitHub as well. This created an automatic commit (with me as the author) to put the [_config.yml](docs/_config.yml) in the /docs folder.
* After this was done, the site was successfully published at [erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/](https://erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/)!
