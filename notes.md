# Notes â€” Week 5

## Sound

### Podcasting

* I used Soundcloud to host the short podcast excerpt I made.

### Sonification

## Mapping

### Telling stories with StoryMaps

* [I made a StoryMap about King Tut's adventures in Ancient Egypt](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/d1b23d0d71274aab66568347ebc8e1d4/demo-story-map/index.html).
* I mostly used images from Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons.
* I noticed that the location entered would be lost if I switched slides without saving, so I made sure to save after choosing a location for the slide.
* I wish I could have just entered a coordinate pair from Google Maps rather than using KnightLab's coordinate syntax. I could have easily been more precise that way.
* Overall, the software is easy and quick to use.

### Webmapping with Leaflet

### Adding a new layer to our map

### Georectifying a base map

### Adding a layer control button

### Adding animation

## Posters

* Though I had heard of Inkscape before, I had not used it until this exercise.

### Sprucing up a PDF in Inkscape

* That is indeed quite the simple graphic / histogram / bar chart.
* Compared to Photoshop's default of holding Shift (or in recent years, *not* holding Shift), along with many other programs' Shift usage for the same purpose, Ctrl + Shift is a bit of an unusual keyboard combo for keeping proportions the same.
* It's not immediately clear how to set a stroke colour on a rectangle. I ended up right-clicking the shape and clicking "Fill and Stroke..." in the context menu.
* I made a bar cyan, then for the legend, I created a cyan rectangle (square) and put some text that made it seem like there was an increase in articles due to a fictional "1819 Italian economic miracle" event.
* The export option was actually called "Export PNG Image". I'm not sure if I need to select everything for the export to work, either, but maybe that gave it the nice dimensions that only show the chart, rather than the whole canvas (including the empty parts).
* This is pretty handy; I had thought PDFs were much harder to edit than this. I will probably keep this software installed unless I find a better alternative!

### Making an academic poster

## Static websites

* This isn't anything I haven't done before, but let's do it again for practice!
* GitHub Pages is something that tends not to work the first time even if you follow the instrutions verbatim, possibly due to how web hosting works, but it's a fun gamble.
* Because I don't want to affect the *username.github.io* I may already have set up on this GitHub account that's been around for awhile, I instead used this Week 5 repository for GitHub Pages. This makes the static website end up in a subdirectory of *username.github.io*. In my case, [erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/](https://erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/).
* I created the "[index.md](docs/index.md)" rather than at the top level, to separate it from the rest of the repository.
  * I also made [an HTML version](static-websites/unused-index.html) as a backup, in case Markdown didn't end up working.
* After selecting the "master branch /docs folder" as the GitHub Pages source in the repository's settings, I selected a Jekyll theme on GitHub as well. This created an automatic commit (with me as the author) to put the [_config.yml](docs/_config.yml) in the /docs folder.
* After this was done, the site was successfully published at [erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/](https://erikhumphrey.github.io/hist3814o-s20-week5/)!
